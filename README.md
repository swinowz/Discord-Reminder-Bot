## TODO List

- **Bot autocleaning**: Bot autodeletes his own message after a bit of time ( Probably only for the !settings command ) to make chats cleaner 
- **Settings Command Revamping**:
    - Switching reminder language from French to English.
    - Switching to discord default command thing, like the / with autocompletion ( so you do /add and only have to complete some specific parts of the command

## Deleted Most of the readme until I finish it ( WIP )
